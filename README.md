# BCAI4-Group3
Here is the code used in the BCAI4 group project, which records data processing, data characteristics extration, heuristic modelling, RL-based modelling, PT modelling and their validation check.

The .py files recorded raw code while the notebook recorded certain results.  

Specifically, The integrated_analysis.ipynb records both RL-based and PT model building with the parameter check methods and the random BIC simulation (integrate 04, 05, 06 python files).
